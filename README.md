# Capstone Project 2
Statistics on terrorist acts that have happened globally between 1970 and 2017 are available in the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), an open-source database. The GTD offers comprehensive data on terrorist occurrences that have occurred over this time, both domestically and abroad. As of right now, it covers approximately 180,000 attacks. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), situated at the University of Maryland, employs researchers who are in charge of keeping the database updated.
The project concentrated on conducting basic research on a range of subjects, such as locating terrorist hotspots, analysing attack and victim types, identifying notable offenders, and the total amount of damage caused by terrorist activity.
